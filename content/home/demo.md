Welcome to the **Academic Kickstart** template!

You will use this template to set up your online academic presence.

1. Go to [github.com](http://github.com) and get signed up. Make your username/account name `your-name`
2. Now that you’re logged into Github, go [here](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart) and hit the green button
3. It will confirm that you want to connect netlify to github. Say yes.
4. It then has a box that says `academic-kickstart` and that it will create a repository in that name. Click the green save and deploy button.
5. Gears will grind, things will happen. Eventually the page will say, congrats! You now have a site at `silly-word-number.netlify.com`. Find the edit button to change the domain name. It is behind the button that says ‘domain settings’ then under ‘custom domains’ there’s a button on the right with three dots . . . Click that and you can change it to your-name.netlify.com. (As long as that subdomain doesn't already exist).
